I have 4 types of node: Users, Posts, Meetings, and Message. Users can make posts and hold meetings. They can also send message to other user and users can reveice message. I have meesage because I want people to be able to dm each other when using the platform. Meetings are held for reunion or meeting new people. Post, send, host, and connect are 4 types of edges, which are the actions between nodes. The properties are listed in the graph below the nodes.
